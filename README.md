Conway's Game of Life
=====================

**Description:** Conway's Game of Life implemented in C++ with [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org/ "Official SFML website"). This project was made in less than 3 hours, I think, and made the same day I first started using SFML! (as per the recommendation of good Xelvair)

**Author's note:** All I can say is that SFML is much easier to use than SDL and this is a proof-of-concept of how much easier it is. I had a very hard time with SDL.
