Conway's Game of Life!
======================

Conway's Game of Life implemented in C++ with SFML, this was made in less than 3 hours I think, and I made this the same day I first started using SFML! (as per the 
recommendation of good Xelvair)
All I can say is that SFML is much easier to use than SDL and this is a proof-of-concept of how much easier it is. I had a very hard time with SDL..
